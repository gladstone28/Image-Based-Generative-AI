# INTRO TO GENERATIVE AI

## Image-Based Generative AI

Some of the most impressive results from generative AIs come from those that generate images. With only a text description, masterpieces can easily be generated, even on most home computers.

A remarkable example of this technology is Dall-E. It is trained using millions of images from the internet, giving it the capability to generate images about any topic and imitating the art style of any era.

So, what are the applications of image-based generative AI? Besides creating completely new images, this AI can also modify existing images based on inputted templates. This revolutionizes the graphic design industry, allowing those with less artistic talent to more easily convey their ideas and designs.

AI can also be used to customize designs in sectors like clothing or architecture before beginning manufacturing or construction, saving resources and improving customer satisfaction. It can further be used to help train workers. For example, images for specific diagnoses can be generated to train medical professionals about rare diseases or surgeries, without violating a patientâ€™s privacy.

Any modern use of images can be enhanced by this type of generative AI. By learning how to best use it, anyone can improve their communication by generating new works of art.
